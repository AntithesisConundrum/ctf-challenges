# CTF Training Challenges
Some CTF challenges I initially cooked up as practice for RiceSec. I designed them as tasks that an
undergraduate-level CTF team should be able to figure out. Remember to keep a security mindset about
you - you win by cheating!

## Use
If you want to use these for any purpose other than individual training, please contact me
